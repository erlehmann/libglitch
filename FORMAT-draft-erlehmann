Abstract

   The glitch file format is a lightweight, text-based, language-
   independent program interchange format. It is used to specify
   programs to be executed on a stack machine that generates a
   bitstream. The output is commonly interpreted as audio data.


1.  Introduction

   The glitch file format is a text format for the serialization of
   programs generating bitstreams. It is derived from the implementation
   of the iOS application Glitch Machine [GLITCHMACHINE].

   Programs noted in the glitch file format (glitches) contain
   instructions for a stack machine and integer constants. Its design
   goals were for it to be minimal, portable and textual.

   The glitch file format was intended to be usable in microblogging
   applications. Those commonly limit textual messages to 140 characters
   to force messages to be terse and discourage intelligent discourse
   [HTML].

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC4234].

2.   Glitch File Format Grammar

   A glitch consists of sequences of characters. In general, a glitch is
   written as follows:

   <title>!<instructions>

   Title names consist of a sequence of zero or more characters, with
   an upper limit of 16 characters. The lower case letters "a"--"z",
   digits and the character underscore ("_") are allowed.

   Instructions consist of one or more lines separated by exclamation
   marks ("!"), with an upper limit of 16 lines.

   Lines consist of a sequence of one or more characters, with an upper
   limit of 16 characters. The upper case letters "A"--"Z", lower case
   letters "a"--"z", numbers "0"--"9" and the period (".") are allowed.

2.1    BNF for the Glitch File Format

   alphalower     = %x61-7A

   glitch         = title %0x21 instructions [%x0A]
   title          = 0*16[alphalower | digit | %x5F]
   line           = 1*16[alpha | digit | %x2E]
   instructions   = 0*15[(line %0x21)] line

2.2.   Advice for Implementors

   For interoperability with implementations using fixed-width glyphs,
   programs SHOULD NOT produce glitches with lines of more than 16
   characters.

   Programs interpreting glitches SHOULD output a warning when
   encountering any title or line exceeding 16 characters. For
   robustness, programs SHOULD try to interpret such input, by
   truncating the title to 16 characters and splitting lines.

   If a program automatically truncates or splits lines, it SHOULD
   output a warning and SHOULD NOT let users save the changed content
   without further user intervention.

   Programs interpreting glitches MUST output a warning when
   encountering any character other than "A"--"Z", "a"--"z", "0"--"9",
   "_", ".", "!" or a single new line (LF) at the end of input and
   SHOULD stop interpretion.

   Warnings MUST NOT be output to the standard output.

3.    Glitch Stack Machine

3.1.   Stack Machine

   Interpreting programs written in the glitch file format is done using
   a virtual stack machine. The stack is a ring buffer with 256 cells
   that can hold an unsigned 32-bit integer and are initialized to hold
   a value of zero (0). In this context, setting a cell to a value means
   setting it to that value truncated to the last 32bits.

   A top-of-stack pointer (TOSP), holding an unsigned 8-bit integer,
   points to the current cell. Pushing a value to the stack means adding
   one (1) to the TOSP, then setting the current cell to that value.
   Popping from the stack means getting the current value, then subtracting
   one (1) from the TOSP.

3.3.   Opcodes

   The following table details opcode names and their shorthands. For
   brevity, abbreviations are used for the top-of-stack pointer (TOSP),
   cell values (using stack indices within brackets “[” and “]”) and
   values retrieved or computed in previous numbered steps (V1, V2 …).

   Not listed lower case and upper case letters are reserved and MUST
   NOT be used for opcodes. Additional opcodes can be added to the
   specification as soon as two independent implementations with equal
   output exist and at least one other implementator pledges to also
   implement the specified behaviour.

   Programs interpreting glitches MAY optimize opcode behaviour, if the
   output does not change.

3.4.   Execution and Output

   Programs interpreting glitches SHOULD execute all contained opcodes
   8000 times per second. After each time a glitch is executed, a
   program MUST pop from the stack. The last 8 bits of values retrieved
   this way constitute a sample.

   Samples SHOULD be written to standard output, sound devices or files.
   Sample output MAY happen immediately or be buffered. If buffering is
   used, programs SHOULD buffer at most 256 samples at a time. The
   resulting output frequency of 31.25hz is adequate for visualisations.

4. IANA Considerations

   The MIME media type for the glitch file format is
   application/x-glitch.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: x-glitch

   Required parameters: n/a

   Optional parameters: n/a

   Encoding considerations:

      A glitch MUST be represented using ASCII.


5.  Security Considerations

   The glitch file format does not in itself pose a security threat. Due
   to lack of branching and looping instructions a conforming
   implementation can not enter an infinite loop.

   Implementors SHOULD ensure their implementations handle variable
   overflows and underflows securely. Users SHOULD take note that there
   is no general guarantee that an implementation contains no security
   holes.

6.  Applications that use this media type

   The glitch file format has been used in libglitch [LIBGLITCH].
