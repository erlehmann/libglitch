libglitch makes 8-bit sounds in the spirit of viznut's [“algorithmic symphonies”][1], using a small language not entirely unlike Forth. Included is a small programm reading formulas from the command line. GNU/Linux users may try “./glitter.py glitch_machine!a10k4h1f!aAk5h2ff!aCk3hg!ad3e!p!9fm!a4kl13f!aCk7Fhn | aplay -f u8”.

libglitch is inspired by a [comment from madgarden][2], who kindly provided the [opcodes][3] he uses in his iPhone application and [some source code][4].
